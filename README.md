User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

Acceptance Criteria
The app should:
- Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
- Persist events between refreshes of a page.
